This repository is for my Design and Analysis of Algorithms class, where i put all my assignment and programs for future consultation in case i change my computer or even loose my data,
i will know where to find all the files that i have previously worked on and that will make my life a little bit easier.

The term project for that class that i chose to work on, was the implementation of the boolean satisfiability using the infamous genetic algorithm.
